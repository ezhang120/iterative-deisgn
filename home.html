      <p class = "par" >
        The purpose of this group project was to <b class = "bold">design an interface for an emerging startup</b>. <br>
        To begin, we sketched out ideas for the interface and made wireframes based on our sketches.
        Then, we made multiple iterations of a high-fidelity prototype. After receiving feedback on 
        our prototype from our peers as well as an industry guest, we made changes to our prototype and 
        submitted it to a user testing service.

          as help customers establish real relationships with local farms. Taking a user-centric
          approach, <b class = "bold"> we decided to design a website that allows users who are looking for more organic

                <li>Having both “Our Stores” and “Shop” tabs in the navigation bar is confusing because the selection of stores mainly acts as a filter when users are shopping. <b class = "bold">Create a hierarchy of functionalities and build other functionalities off of that</b>.

                <li>
                  The “Update” button in the “Shopping Cart” page isn’t necessary because it <b class = "bold">requires an extra click from users</b>.

                  The Roberto Monospace font gives the company a technological aesthetic. Think about how <b class = "bold">typography conveys a message to users</b>.

                <li>

              Overall, users thought the simplicity of the website was nice but lacked key information and visual indicators.
              User confusion was further amplified by mistakes we made in setting up the user testing.
              Due to our inexperience with the user testing website, we made the subtasks separate from
              the main task with the assumption that the main task would be clearly visible, when that was
              not the case. This led to an abnormally high focus on the “Select Location” page and lack
              of critique on the “Checkout” page. In the future, we’d like to structure the user testing so that the subtasks and the main task are much more directly related.

                  <li>
                    Remove the “Select Location” and “Subscription” module from the home page and replace it with a short blurb with information about the company and the service.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Specify what kind of location users should enter into the search bar (they should be entering in their personal address).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Add a “Select Location” module to the top navigation bar and show suggestions of user-inputted location in the dropdown menu when the user is searching for their location.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Modify item descriptions in the “Shop” page to be clearer on the exact quantity of a product being sold and for how much.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Remove the ability to navigate to the “Shop” page by clicking on the homepage banner. Add a small button to navigate to the advertised sale instead of making the entire banner responsive.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Replace the “Select Location” modal window with an entirely new page for clarity (or change the size of the modal window so it takes up the entire page and doesn’t show the design underneath).
                  </li>
                </ul>

                Through this Iterative Design project, I learned what it is like to work on a UI/UX project as a team. 
                I also had the opportunity to receive and give design critiques, which helped me to be more open to different 
                design choices. After finishing this project, we contacted Milkrun and shared our final prototype, and we are currently 
                waiting for their response.
