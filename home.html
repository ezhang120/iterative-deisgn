        Iterative Design

      <div id ="description">
        The purpose of this project was to design an interface for an emerging startup. 
        We began with sketching out ideas for the interface, then made wireframes based on our sketches,
        and lastly made multiple iterations of a high-fidelity prototype. We made changes to our prototype
        after receiving feedback and submitted the interface to a user testing service.

          Milkrun is an online marketplace that aims to connect city dwellers to local
          food products by mitigating both the time spent and steps taken for food delivery
          and distribution. It strives to supply fresh groceries in a timely manner as well
          as help customers establish real relationships with local farms. Taking a user-centric
          approach, we decided to design a website that allows users who are looking for more organic
          options to purchase groceries from local stores and subscribe to a grocery-delivery service.

            Shop: All products should have an appealing image and have a button to easily increase or decrease quantity underneath.

              During our studio, we received some critiques regarding our hi-fi mockups. Below, we have included a list of the critique feedback.   
            </div>
            <div id="p">
              <ol>
                <li>Having both “Our Stores” and “Shop” tabs in the navigation bar is confusing because the selection of stores mainly acts as a filter when users are shopping. Create a hierarchy of functionalities and build other functionalities off of that. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The “Update” button in the “Shopping Cart” page isn’t necessary and it requires an extra click from users. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Roberto Monospace font gives the company a technological aesthetic. Think about how typography conveys a message to users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The +/- button in the “Shop” page is not consistent with the “Update/Remove” button in the “Shopping Cart” page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Show item price in the “Shopping Cart” page. Don’t expect the users to remember the prices of each item. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The “Home” page doesn’t look scrollable because the “Find Your City” box and the “Subscribe” button aren’t very visible when the “Home” page first loads. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  It’s unnecessary to have to fill out new information on the checkout page when it should already be saved through the profile.

                  We removed the “Our Stores” tab in the navigation bar to maintain a consistent hierarchy of functionalities. Users can now navigate to the shops page if they wish to see the entire selection of stores by clicking on the “Browse Stores” link under the “Producer” filter on the “Shops” page. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  We removed the “Update” button on the checkout page to update the number of items in the cart because we decided it would be best if the prices and items automatically updated without the need for an extra update button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We changed our website font to one that has less of a technological feel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We replaced the +/- button on the “Shop” page to an input box (similar to the one on the “Checkout Page”) for more consistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We added the prices for individual items on the “Checkout Page.”

                <li>
                  We moved the “Find Your City” and “Subscribe” boxes up (so the tops of the boxes can be seen) to give an indication that there is more to be seen at the bottom of the homepage. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  We changed the checkout page so information is automatically filled and the user only needs to confirm that the information is correct or make necessary changes.

              In addition, they were also provided with 3 subtasks to complete:

                <li>
                  (Do this for each page) Without leaving this page, in your own words, describe what do you think you can do on this website? Be specific.

              Contrary to our expectations, users found navigating our prototype confusing and difficult. A few specific problems brought to our attention were:
            </div>
            <div id="p">
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Users did not understand what exactly the company and service entailed and were confused on the details of the subscription and location UI elements. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  When navigating to the “Select Location” page, users commented how it wasn’t clear how the search bar worked and what the dropdown menu options were. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The UI for increasing the number of items in the cart was vague, and the “Profile” section was left untouched. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The design of the “Find Location” modal window was confusing because it looked very similar to the design of the homepage, which peeked through at the bottom.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div id="p">
              Overall, users thought the simplicity of the website was nice but lacked key information and visual indicators.
              User confusion was further amplified by mistakes we made in setting up the user testing.
              Due to our inexperience with the user testing website, we made the subtasks separate from
              the main task with the assumption that the main task would be clearly visible, when that was
              not the case. This led to an abnormally high focus on the “Select Location” page and lack
              of critique on the “Checkout” page. In the future, we’d like to structure the user testing such that the subtasks and the main task are much more directly related.

                Based on the user testing videos, here are some potential changes we can make to our interface.

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Remove the “Select Location” and “Subscription” module from the home page and replace it with a short blurb with information about the company and the service.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Specify what kind of location users should enter into the search bar (they should be entering in their personal address).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Add a “Select Location” module to the top navigation bar and show suggestions of user-inputted location in the dropdown menu when the user is searching for their location.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Modify item descriptions in the “Shop” page to be clearer on the exact quantity of a product being sold and for how much.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Remove the ability to navigate to the “Shop” page by clicking on the homepage banner. Add a small button to navigate to the advertised sale instead of making the entire banner responsive.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Replace the “Select Location” modal window with an entirely new page for clarity (or change the size of the modal window so it takes up the entire page and doesn’t show the design underneath).
                  </li>
                </ol>

                Through this Iterative Design project, we learned what it is like to work on a UI/UX project as a team. 
                We also had the opportunity to receive and give design critiques, which helped us to be more open to different 
                design choices. After finishing this project, we contacted Milkrun and shared our final prototype, and we are currently 
                waiting for their response. We hope you enjoyed reading about our project!
